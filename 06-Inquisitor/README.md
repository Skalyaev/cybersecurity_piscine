Introductory project on understanding the network from a low-level perspective.

The so-called OSI model is the architecture followed by computer networks from all over the planet. It consists of 7 layers, each of which carries risks and is exposed to different types of vulnerabilities and forms of exploitation.
At the network level, there are elements in charge of deciding where to direct the traffic. Every local network has a default gateway, which receives external traffic and distributes it among its nodes. This gateway is usually also known as router.
If a network node is able to impersonate the gateway, it can take control of the traffic, intercept it and decide who to forward it to, as well as being able to modify or block it.
ARP spoofing can also be used legitimately, for example to redirect new connections to a registration page before using a network, as is common in networks open doors of airports, cafeterias and other public places.
