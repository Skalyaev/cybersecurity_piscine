# Stockholm

Introduction to file manipulation by creating a harmless malware.

In this project you will develop a small program with the aim of understanding how malware works.
We will focus on ransomware. A specific feature of this type of program is its ability to spread through networks of hundreds of computers. In our case, your program will only affect a small portion of your local files. Itâ€™s all about understanding how a fairly simple program works in order to better protect yourself from it.
