# Cybersecurity Piscine

Piscines are an important time in your cursus, during which you will have the occasion to learn a new language, or even a new paradigm!

What is a piscine?
Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (modules), and with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on.

- **Arachnida (web)**: Introductory project on scraping but also on the discovery of metadatas.
- **ft_otp (OTP)**: Introductory project to the notion of OTP with the use of the RFC HOTP.
- **ft_onion (web)**: Introductory project allowing the implementation of a hidden service on tor.
- **Reverse me (rev)**: Introductory project to the discipline of reverse engineering.
- **Stockholm (malware)**: Introduction to file manipulation by creating a harmless malware.
- **Iron Dome (malware)**: Introduction to the detection and monitoring of malicious activity. This project is optional.
- **Inquisitor (network)**: Introductory project on understanding the network from a low-level perspective.
- **Vaccine (web)**: Introductory project to understand a very well known web vulnerability, the famous SQLI. You will have to create a tool to automate your actions.
